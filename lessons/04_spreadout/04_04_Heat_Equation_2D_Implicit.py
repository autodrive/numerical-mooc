# Spreading out
"""
"""
We're back! This is the fourth notebook of _Spreading out: parabolic PDEs,_  Module 4 of the course [**"Practical Numerical Methods with Python"**](http://openedx.seas.gwu.edu/courses/GW/MAE6286/2014_fall/about). 

In the [previous notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/numerical-mooc/numerical-mooc/blob/master/lessons/04_spreadout/04_03_Heat_Equation_2D_Explicit.ipynb), we solved a 2D problem for the first time, using an explicit scheme. We know explicit schemes have stability constraints that might make them impractical in some cases, due to requiring a very small time step. Implicit schemes are unconditionally stable, offering the advantage of larger time steps; in [notebook 2](https://github.com/numerical-mooc/numerical-mooc/blob/master/lessons/04_spreadout/04_02_Heat_Equation_1D_Implicit.ipynb), we look at the 1D implicit solution of diffusion. Already, that was quite a lot of work: setting up a matrix of coefficients and a right-hand-side vector, while taking care of the boundary conditions, and then solving the linear system. And now, we want to do implicit schemes in 2Dâ€”are you ready for this challenge?

## 2D Heat conduction
"""
"""
We already studied 2D heat conduction in the previous lesson, but now we want to work out how to build an implicit solution scheme. To refresh your memory, here is the heat equation again:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \alpha \left(\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial y^2} \right)
\end{equation}

Our previous solution used a Dirichlet boundary condition on the left and bottom boundaries, with $T(x=0)=T(y=0)=100$, and a Neumann boundary condition with zero flux on the top and right edges, with $q_x=q_y=0$.

$$
\left( \left.\frac{\partial T}{\partial y}\right|_{y=0.1} = q_y \right) \quad \text{and} \quad \left( \left.\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}\right|_{x=0.1} = q_x \right)$$

Figure 1 shows a sketch of the problem set up for our hypothetical computer chip with two hot edges and two insulated edges.

### Implicit schemes in 2D
"""
"""
An implicit discretization will evaluate the spatial derivatives at the next time level, $t^{n+1}$, using the unknown values of the solution variable. For the 2D heat equation with central difference in space, that is written as:

\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{T^{n+1}_{i,j} - T^n_{i,j}}{\Delta t} & \nonumber \\
= \alpha &\left( \frac{T^{n+1}_{i+1, j} 
- 2T^{n+1}_{i,j} + T^{n+1}_{i-1,j}}{\Delta x^2} + \frac{T^{n+1}_{i, j+1} - 2T^{n+1}_{i,j} + T^{n+1}_{i,j-1}}{\Delta y^2}\right)
\end{eqnarray}

This equation looks better when we put what we *don't know* on the left and what we *do know* on the right. Make sure to work this out yourself on a piece of paper.

\begin{eqnarray}
-\frac{\alpha\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} \left(T^{n+1}_{i-1,j}+T^{n+1}_{i+1,j}\right) &+ \left(1 + 2\frac{\alpha\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} + 2\frac{\alpha\Delta t}{\Delta y^2}\right) T^{n+1}_{i,j} \nonumber \\
&-\frac{\alpha\Delta t}{\Delta y^2} \left(T^{n+1}_{i,j-1}+T^{n+1}_{i,j+1}\right) = T^n_{i,j}
\end{eqnarray}

To make this discussion easier, let's assume that the mesh spacing is the same in both directions and $\Delta x=\Delta y = \delta$:

\begin{equation}
-T^{n+1}_{i-1,j} - T^{n+1}_{i+1,j} + \left(\frac{\delta^2}{\alpha \Delta t} + 4 \right) T^{n+1}_{i,j} - T^{n+1}_{i,j-1}-T^{n+1}_{i,j+1} = \frac{\delta^2}{\alpha \Delta t}T^n_{i,j}
\end{equation}

Just like in the one-dimensional case, $T_{i,j}$ appears in the equation for $T_{i-1,j}$, $T_{i+1,j}$, $T_{i,j+1}$ and $T_{i,j-1}$, and we can form a linear system to advance in time. But, how do we construct the matrix in this case? What are the $(i+1,j)$, $(i-1,j)$, $(i,j+1)$, and $(i,j-1)$ positions in the matrix?

With explicit schemes we don't need to worry about these things. We can lay out the data just as it is in the physical problem.  We had an array `T` that was a 2-dimensional matrix. To fetch the temperature in the next node in the $x$ direction $(T_{i+1,j})$ we just did `T[j,i+1]`, and likewise in the $y$ direction $(T_{i,j+1})$ was in `T[j+1,i]`. In implicit schemes, we need to think a bit harder about how the data is mapped to the physical problem.

Also, remember from the [notebook on 1D-implicit schemes](https://github.com/numerical-mooc/numerical-mooc/blob/master/lessons/04_spreadout/04_02_Heat_Equation_1D_Implicit.ipynb) that the linear system had $N-2$ elements? We applied boundary conditions on nodes $i=0$ and $i=N-1$, and they were not modified by the linear system. In 2D, this becomes a bit more complicated.  


Let's use Figure 1, representing a set of grid nodes in two dimensions, to guide the discussion.
"""
"""
#### <img src="./figures/2D_discretization.png">  Figure 2: Layout of matrix elements in 2D problem
"""
"""
Say we have the 2D domain of size $L_x\times L_y$ discretized in $n_x$ and $n_y$ points. We can divide the nodes into boundary nodes (empty circles) and interior nodes (filled circles).

The boundary nodes, as the name says, are on the boundary. They are the nodes with indices $(i=0,j)$, $(i=n_x-1,j)$, $(i,j=0)$, and $(i,j=n_y-1)$, and boundary conditions are enforced there.

The interior nodes are not on the boundary, and the finite-difference equation acts on them. If we leave the boundary nodes aside for the moment, then the grid will have $(n_x-2)\cdot(n_y-2)$ nodes that need to be updated on each time step. This is the number of unknowns in the linear system. The matrix of coefficients will have $\left( (n_x-2)\cdot(n_y-2) \right)^2$ elements (most of them zero!).

To construct the matrix, we will iterate over the nodes in an x-major order: index $i$ will run faster. The order will be 

*  $(i=1,j=1)$
*  $(i=2,j=1)$ ...
*  $(i=nx-2,j=1)$
*  $(i=1,j=2)$
*  $(i=2,j=2)$ ... 
*  $(i=n_x-2,j=n_y-2)$. 

That is the ordering represented by dotted line on Figure 1. Of course, if you prefer to organize the nodes differently, feel free to do so!

Because we chose this ordering, the equation for nodes $(i-1,j)$ and $(i+1,j)$ will be just before and after $(i,j)$, respectively. But what about $(i,j-1)$ and $(i,j+1)$? Even though in the physical problem they are very close, the equations are $n_x-2$ places apart! This can tie your head in knots pretty quickly. 

_The only way to truly understand it is to make your own diagrams and annotations on a piece of paper and reconstruct this argument!_
"""
"""
### Boundary conditions
"""
"""
Before we attempt to build the matrix, we need to think about boundary conditions. There is some bookkeeping to be done here, so bear with us for a moment.

Say, for example, that the left and bottom boundaries have Dirichlet boundary conditions, and the top and right boundaries have Neumann boundary conditions.

Let's look at each case:

**Bottom boundary:**
    
The equation for $j=1$ (interior points adjacent to the bottom boundary) uses values from $j=0$, which are known. Let's put that on the right-hand side of the equation. We get this equation for all points across the $x$-axis that are adjacent to the bottom boundary:

\begin{equation}
-T^{n+1}_{i-1,1} - T^{n+1}_{i+1,1} + \left(\frac{\delta^2}{\alpha \Delta t} + 4 \right) T^{n+1}_{i,1}-T^{n+1}_{i,j+1} = \frac{\delta^2}{\alpha \Delta t}T^n_{i,1} + T^{n+1}_{i,0}
\end{equation}

**Left boundary:**

Like for the bottom boundary, the equation for $i=1$ (interior points adjacent to the left boundary) uses known values from $i=0$, and we will put that on the right-hand side:

\begin{equation}
- T^{n+1}_{2,j} + \left(\frac{\delta^2}{\alpha \Delta t} + 4 \right) T^{n+1}_{1,j} - T^{n+1}_{1,j-1}-T^{n+1}_{1,j+1} = \frac{\delta^2}{\alpha \Delta t}T^n_{1,j} + T^{n+1}_{0,j}
\end{equation}

**Right boundary:**

Say the boundary condition is $\left. \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} \right|_{x=L_x} = q_x$. Its finite-difference approximation  is

\begin{equation}
\frac{T^{n+1}_{n_x-1,j} - T^{n+1}_{n_x-2,j}}{\delta} = q_x
\end{equation}

We can write $T^{n+1}_{n_x-1,j} = \delta q_x + T^{n+1}_{n_x-2,j}$ to get the finite difference equation for $i=n_x-2$:

\begin{eqnarray}
-T^{n+1}_{n_x-3,j} + \left(\frac{\delta^2}{\alpha \Delta t} + 3 \right) T^{n+1}_{n_x-2,j} - T^{n+1}_{n_x-2,j-1}-T^{n+1}_{n_x-2,j+1} \nonumber\\
= \frac{\delta^2}{\alpha \Delta t}T^n_{n_x-2,j} + \delta q_x
\end{eqnarray}

Not sure about this? Grab pen and paper! _Please_, check this yourself. It will help you understand!

**Top boundary:**

Neumann boundary conditions specify the derivative normal to the boundary: $\left. \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \right|_{y=L_y} = q_y$. No need to repeat what we did for the right boundary, right? The equation for $j=n_y-2$ is

\begin{eqnarray}
-T^{n+1}_{i-1,n_y-2} - T^{n+1}_{i+1,n_y-2} + \left(\frac{\delta^2}{\alpha \Delta t} + 3 \right) T^{n+1}_{i,n_y-2} - T^{n+1}_{i,n_y-3} \nonumber\\
=\frac{\delta^2}{\alpha \Delta t}T^n_{i,n_y-2} + \delta q_y
\end{eqnarray}

So far, we have then 5 possible cases: bottom, left, right, top, and interior points. Does this cover everything? What about corners?
"""
"""
**Bottom-left corner**

At $T_{1,1}$ there is a Dirichlet boundary condition at $i=0$ and $j=0$. This equation is:

\begin{eqnarray}
- T^{n+1}_{2,1} + \left(\frac{\delta^2}{\alpha \Delta t} + 4 \right) T^{n+1}_{1,1} - T^{n+1}_{1,2} & \nonumber \\
= \frac{\delta^2}{\alpha \Delta t}T^n_{1,1} + T^{n+1}_{0,1} + T^{n+1}_{1,0} &
\end{eqnarray}

**Top-left corner:**

At $T_{1,n_y-2}$ there is a Dirichlet boundary condition at $i=0$ and a Neumann boundary condition at $i=n_y-1$. This equation is:

\begin{eqnarray}
- T^{n+1}_{2,n_y-2} + \left(\frac{\delta^2}{\alpha \Delta t} + 3 \right) T^{n+1}_{1,n_y-2} - T^{n+1}_{1,n_y-3} &\nonumber \\
= \frac{\delta^2}{\alpha \Delta t}T^n_{1,n_y-2} + T^{n+1}_{0,n_y-2} + \delta q_y &
\end{eqnarray}

**Top-right corner**

At $T_{n_x-2,n_y-2}$, there are Neumann boundary conditions at both $i=n_x-1$ and $j=n_y-1$. The finite difference equation is then

\begin{eqnarray}
-T^{n+1}_{n_x-3,n_y-2} + \left(\frac{\delta^2}{\alpha \Delta t} + 2 \right) T^{n+1}_{n_x-2,n_y-2} - T^{n+1}_{n_x-2,n_y-3} &\nonumber \\
= \frac{\delta^2}{\alpha \Delta t}T^n_{n_x-2,n_y-2} + \delta(q_x + q_y)&
\end{eqnarray}

**Bottom-right corner**

To calculate $T_{n_x-2,1}$ we need to consider a Dirichlet boundary condition to the bottom and a Neumann boundary condition to the right. We will get a similar equation to the top-left corner!

\begin{eqnarray}
-T^{n+1}_{n_x-3,1} + \left(\frac{\delta^2}{\alpha \Delta t} + 3 \right) T^{n+1}_{n_x-2,1}-T^{n+1}_{n_x-2,2} & \nonumber \\
= \frac{\delta^2}{\alpha \Delta t}T^n_{n_x-2,1} + T^{n+1}_{n_x-2,0} + \delta q_x &
\end{eqnarray}

Okay, now we are actually ready. We have checked every possible case!
"""
"""
### The linear system
"""
"""
Like in the previous lesson introducing implicit schemes, we will solve a linear system at every time step:

$$[A][T^{n+1}_\text{int}] = [b]+[b]_{b.c.}$$

The coefficient matrix now takes some more work to figure out and to build in code. There is no substitute for you working this out patiently on paper!

The structure of the matrix can be described as a series of diagonal blocks, and lots of zeroes elsewhere. Look at Figure 3, representing the block structure of the coefficient matrix, and refer back to Figure 2, showing the discretization grid in physical space. The first row of interior points, adjacent to the bottom boundary, generates the matrix block labeled $A_1$. The top row of interior points, adjacent to the top boundary generates the matrix block labeled $A_3$. All other interior points in the grid generate similar blocks, labeled $A_2$ on Figure 3.

T^{n+1}_{n_x-2,n_y-2}

   * Why in the last row the diagonal is $\sigma^\prime + 2$ rather than $\sigma^\prime + 4$?

##### Dig deeper

"""
For demonstration purposes, these functions are very explicit. But you can see a trend here, right? 

Say we start with a matrix with `1/sigma+4` in the main diagonal, and `-1` on the 4 other corresponding diagonals. Now, we have to modify the matrix only where the boundary conditions are affecting. We saw the impact of the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary condition on each position of the matrix, we just need to know in which position to perform those changes. 

A function that maps `i` and `j` into `row_number` would be handy, right? How about `row_number = (j-1)*(nx-2)+(i-1)`? By feeding `i` and `j` to that equation, you know exactly where to operate on the matrix. For example, `i=nx-2, j=2`, which is in row `row_number = 2*nx-5`, is next to a Neumann boundary condition: we have to substract one out of the main diagonal (`A[2*nx-5,2*nx-5]-=1`), and put a zero in the next column (`A[2*nx-5,2*nx-4]=0`). This way, the function can become much simpler!

Can you use this information to construct a more general function `generateMatrix`? Can you make it such that the type of boundary condition is an input to the function?

Does this result match the explicit scheme from the previous notebook? Do they take the same amount of time to reach $70^\circ C$ in the center of the plate? Now that we can use higher values of `sigma`, we need fewer time steps for the center of the plate to reach $70^\circ C$! Of course, we need to be careful that `dt` is small enough to resolve the physics correctly.
